# *Aurore*, *Inside the Void*, and the Power of Neon

First impressions are essential for a game; when people think of pink skies and cyan rivers, they might see a game that is lighthearted. These games are the mold breakers; From the lovechild of *Journey* and *ABZU* born on cloud nine to what *No Man's Sky* could have been, *Aurore* and *Inside the Void* have similar palettes but vastly different tones. 

In this essay, I will discuss these games in depth, from their aesthetic and accessibility to tones and tunes, it's gonna be a long ride.
