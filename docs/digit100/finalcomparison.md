# *Aurore*, *Inside the Void*, and the Power of Neon

First impressions are essential for a game; when people think of pink skies and cyan rivers, they might see a game that is lighthearted. These games are the mold breakers; From the lovechild of *Journey* and *ABZU* born on cloud nine to what *No Man's Sky* could have been, *Aurore* and *Inside the Void* have similar palettes but vastly different tones. 

In this essay, I will discuss these games in depth, from their aesthetic and accessibility to tones and tunes, it's gonna be a long ride. 

## Atmosphere

## Gameplay

## Controls
*Aurore* and *Inside the Void* have similar controls, with differences between them concerning their gameplay. The WASD control scheme functions well in both games, with the main differences involving the mouse. *Inside the Void* uses it solely as the camera, with the mouse buttons serving to advance the story in cutscenes. Unlike *Aurore*, interacting with objects is mapped to the E key, with text appearing whenever there is an object the player can interact with. Other than status logs and objects made by the crew, interactions that would require input occur automatically, leaving the player to immerse themselves in the story and keep moving forward.

Unlike *Inside the Void*, the mouse is the center of *Aurore's* gameplay. Serving as the game's camera, the mouse buttons allow the player to resize objects in their vicinity. It works on paper, but the mouse sensitivity needs work. In my play throughs of *Aurore*, I adjusted the mouse sensativity several times, only noticing the difference when it was at its minimum or maximum. I believe that *Aurore's* controls are better suited for an *Xbox* controller compared to a keyboard, but if the mouse sensitivity was refined, I would be more forgiving of the game's camera.
