# *Aurore*, *Inside the Void*, and the Power of Neon

First impressions are essential for a game; when people think of pink skies and cyan rivers, they might see a game that is lighthearted. These games are the mold breakers; From the lovechild of *Journey* and *ABZU* born on cloud nine to what *No Man's Sky* could have been, *Aurore* and *Inside the Void* have similar palettes but vastly different tones. 

In this essay, I will discuss these games in depth, from their aesthetic and accessibility to tones and tunes, it's gonna be a long ride. 

## Atmosphere
*Aurore* and *Inside The Void* have massive worlds, providing depth and instilling a desire to explore within the player. Each setting uses colors within the pastel palette, including pink, blue, yellow, white, and grey, giving the setting a "supernatural" aura. While the colors are similar, the direction each game's art style takes is different and will be discussed in-depth here. 

*Aurore's* atmosphere is inspired by the concept of secondary worlds, universes we make ourselves that can be as down to earth or surreal as we want them to be. *Aurore* incorporates both, with trees, wind turbines, and train tracks scattered across the world, but are floating in a sky of pink clouds with no solid ground connecting them. They are out-of-place for a sky-like setting, but they work in conjunction with the stone structures, which are unusual in their own right, to create a world that is illogical and welcoming. Even when exploring the cavern-like second half of the game, I was impressed with the atmosphere and wanted to keep moving forward. It's unnaturally natural, and that's the best way I can describe it.

*Inside the Void*, meanwhile, is a stark contrast to *Aurore*; inspired by alien worlds and their civilizations, the colors invoke a sense of the supernatural rather than a sense of homeliness. Everything on the planet is unfamilar to the player, from the blue ground to the pink sky with two suns and white mountains covered in spikes. With a mission to rescue voyagers from year's past, it makes the player dread what lives on this planet, if anything at all, and what they should expect within these alien structures. Signs of life appear within the spires, but neither look nor act natural, and they do not threaten the player. After learning about the planet's fate, it's emptiness becomes apparent and leaves the player to wonder if the crew suffered a similar fate. It's unsettling, compelling, and mororse all at once, leaving the player wondering if all planets turned out this way and if these expeditions are worth it.

## Gameplay

## Controls
*Aurore* and *Inside the Void* have similar controls, with differences between them concerning their gameplay. The WASD control scheme functions well in both games, with the main differences involving the mouse. *Inside the Void* uses it solely as the camera, with the mouse buttons serving to advance the story in cutscenes. Unlike *Aurore*, interacting with objects is mapped to the E key, with text appearing whenever there is an object the player can interact with. Other than status logs and objects made by the crew, interactions that would require input occur automatically, leaving the player to immerse themselves in the story and keep moving forward.

Unlike *Inside the Void*, the mouse is the center of *Aurore's* gameplay. Serving as the game's camera, the mouse buttons allow the player to resize objects in their vicinity. It works on paper, but the mouse sensitivity needs work. In my play throughs of *Aurore*, I adjusted the mouse sensativity several times, only noticing the difference when it was at its minimum or maximum. I believe that *Aurore's* controls are better suited for an *Xbox* controller compared to a keyboard, but if the mouse sensitivity was refined, I would be more forgiving of the camera system.

## Performance
Both games run well on my PC, which is an i5 with 8 GB of RAM. Unfortunately, while *Inside The Void* had no framerate issues, *Aurore* had trouble keeping a consistent framerate. Both games have a minimalist atmosphere and a lot of 3D objects, but I believe *Aurore's* framerate issues can be attributed to the amount of moving pieces; each structure collapses after crossing it, and the rubble remains on screen for players to cross if they are brave enough. When compared to *Inside the Void*, where the structures disappear after the player explores them, it feels like *Aurore* is overworking itself. Maybe once the player has reached a certain point, the structures wculd disappear or be rendered as part of the background, which would put less pressue on the system and keep the framerate consistent. The framerate issues are less noticeable in act two, but it's because there are less moving pieces. 

## Tone

## Narrative
*Aurore's* narrative is entirely up to the player. With no dialog or lore besides pictures in the form of collectibles, the story is abstract as the setting; who is Aurore? why is she here? why can she resize objects? what is her goal? The game is designed to be thought-provoking, with the only answer provided is that "it just is". The player can draw from their own experiences to define the narrative, draw parallels and view the world in a way that makes sense to them, which is what a contemplative game is supposed to be. The narrative is on par with that of other contemplative games I have played, which earns my respect.


## Immersion

## Characters
*Aurore* and *Inside the Void* have one thing in common, and it's the development of their characters; Aurore and Crewmate 1286 (names that are only revealed through the credits and promotional material), share the "blank slate" character archetype; They are faceless, emotionless, expressionless, a stand-in for the player and a reflection that the player is the center of the experience, not the characters themselves. The only details provided about them are their appearance (Aurore) and how they got here (crewmate 1286). Everything else is up to the player, such as their backstory, what their personalities are like, and whether or not they are human. The main differences between them are how they are revealed to the player; the player knows what Aurore looks like from the start, but Crewmate 1286 is revealed during the credits, appearing as a purple-skinned individual (or someone in a purple suit) surrounded by crewmates who look just like them, which is the other difference between them.

Unlike Aurore, Crewmate 1286 interacts with the captain in the beginning, two different aliens, and the lost crew, while she doesn't interact with anyone. The amount of characters between games that sets the tone, and in *Aurore's* case, it's that secondary worlds are ones we keep to ourselves until we allow others into them. for *Inside the Void*, the aliens allude to the crew's whereabouts and the crew themselves are the game's form of closure; the story is centered on finding them, and though crewmate 1286 is with them for all of five minutes, they provide a satisfying ending to a game where the mystery was the selling point. A lack of characters doesn't make a bad story, and a game doesn't need a lot of characters to be good; this is a perfect way to sum up the interactions in each game.
