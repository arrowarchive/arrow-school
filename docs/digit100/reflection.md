# Website Reflection Essay: *GitHub* and *Wordpress*

Coding a website was a journey. I dedicated myself to the subject, knowing that something as small as a website could be crucial once I start job searching. *GitHub* and *Wordpress* were used to develops these websites, and this essay will compare and contrast my experiences with each program.

As a beginner in the world of html code, several challenges came with each program. My biggest challenges with *Github* were acquainting myself with markdown and *Git Bash*. For *Wordpress*, my biggest challenges were learning to navigate the program and searching through pages before solving my problem. Modifying the layout was not difficult over *Github*. I had to make sure my files were in the correct place, correctly named, and correctly structured. My biggest issue with *Wordpress* was that I had to find the theme for my website and alter several pages before publishing my changes. Compared to *Github*, these issues were more frustrating, and I attribute that to a lack of experience with *Wordpress*. 

I believe that time is a necessity for developing a page on *Github and Wordpress*. When developing a *Github* repo, it requires knowledge of the interface, markdown code, and practice with Git Bash before mastering the program in full. Once I educated myself, I hit the ground running, easily relaying code from file to file in order to design my page the way I pictured it. Over *Wordpress*, I felt as if I needed more time to discuss the program and familiarize myself with its format, but when I started developing my *Wordpress* page, I was simultaneously designing it and updating my *Github* repo, leaving little time for me to acquaint myself with the format. After spending two weeks on *Github* and learning the format, I found myself preferring it over *Wordpress* very quickly.

I plan to continue using *Github* and repurposing my page for the assignment into a digital art portfolio. Learning the program was challenging, but I see myself adding more to it, such as embedding code into my website to disable right-clicks and experimenting with different layouts. In addition, I plan to organize the archive section of my website so my thumbnails are the same size and the image descriptions are more eloquent. I donâ€™t plan to continue using *Wordpress*, but I want to learn to navigate the program and find shortcuts through the many menus and pages across the program. 

*Github* was difficult and took time to master, but the results felt more satisfying compared to *Wordpress*. I recommend *Github* to anyone who is unfamiliar with coding and would like to learn, while I recommend *Wordpress* to anyone who is studying design and is focused more on the aesthetic than the coding aspect of web development.
