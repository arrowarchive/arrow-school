    <step>For the simplest of all slime recipes, all you need is cornstarch.</step> Just dump some
    into a bowl, add some water, &amp; start mixing. <step>Keep adding water until it reaches the
        consistency you want</step> (a good place to start is 2 parts cornstarch to 1 part water).
    You can also add food coloring to make it look more legit.
