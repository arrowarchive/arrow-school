What is more important: keeping harmony and covering up inequality, or discussing a controversial topic and trying to settle the dispute? I don't know what the Australian government is like compared to the U.S., but it seems like the former is true, which highly disappoints me. I feel like if the issue happened in the U.S, people would be more willing to discuss it. 
It's wrong to make theories about a person based off of assumptions and loose facts. Humans are complicated, and if a person goes around making assumptions about people, they will either get the facts wrong or end up angering people. I think that inferences can be made after a while, but they should not be stated as fact. It's important to ask if you have the right idea, or else the knowledge you have is misguided. 
I need to ask: is the author of this statement referring to the British, or is he referring to another ethnic group? The use of the word "Westerners" is used vaguely here, and I don't know exactly what group it refers to.
When I think about this phrase, I think about one thing: white people have had power for so long, that for some, seeing other groups advocate for equal rights (and later receiving those rights) seems like a threat to them. If I am reading this incorrectly, then please correct me, but this phrase makes me think that what some people see as "Anti-white" is what others see as "equal rights". 
This reminds me of a memory I have from early high school: I was a freshman and I went to dinner with my dad and brother. We went to a Taco Bell and Long John Silver's, and during dinner, my dad told us that one of our eighth grade teachers passed away. I graduated less than five months ago and my brother graduated two years ago, but I felt as if a number of memories from that class became more important due to that, and they stick with me now because of it. I even remember the night it happened: it was November 1st, 2016. It has been almost four years since then, and although I may not remember a lot of material from the classes I had with the teacher, I remember who he was as a person: he enjoyed teaching the class, he liked sharing political cartoons and mind games, he would satirize what would going on between Hillary and Trump (and would ask for our opinions), and he was very open to discussion. Those are the memories I know best, with the others being his funeral that weekend and the grief that followed. I've heard that memories last longer if there is an emotion associated with them, and that's probably why I remember so much. Losing someone, even if it wasn't a family member, caused those memories to stick with me more, and if I didn't graduate when I did, then it would have had a different impact on me emotionally. 
I know how this feels. There are times where I remember something random and unrelated to what I'm doing in the present (That I remember in an unusual amount of detail), and there are other memories where I can recall what I was doing, yet I can't remember when it happened or at what time. I feel like when you aren't forcing yourself to remember something, it's easier to remember the details surrounding it. If you force yourself to remember something, you either remember a majority of the event but have trouble putting it into words, or forget an essential detail that the brain either remembers at a later point in time or requires someone with a similar train of thought to fill in the blanks (The latter is also very frustrating, since the thought lingers and causes you to reprimand yourself for forgetting) I also agree with the sentiment that I usually see one piece of the puzzle. I've known people with anxiety and depression, but I wouldn't know that until they open up to me. I hear their stories, but I can't imagine them completely because I am limited by my own perspective. 
By nature, we are creatures of habit. It's why people live by the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mantra, it's why some people detest change, It's why people set schedules for themselves as to what times best suit a balance between work and life. I believe that either we know we are creatures of habit and try to find ways to change things up (or open our minds to changing beliefs), or we are creatures of habit and we don't like seeing ourselves as such. The first theory explains why people change and try new things, but the second explains why others are so alarmed about the technology we use tracking us. I'd be interested to hear what others think about this. 
Corollary- a direct consequence or result of a previous action
I feel like the Rule of Simplicity has a lot of influence in today's media. In the mid-2000's/early 2010's, logos, designs etc. had a lot of complexity in their designs. Within the last 5 years, a number of once-complex logos and designs have been replaced with simpler designs, to mixed results. Let me provide an example: Instagram logo (2011): ![](https://i.insider.com/5230c65769beddf84da48e6f?width=750&format=jpeg&auto=webp) Instagram logo (2016-present): ![](https://1000logos.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/New-Instagram-logo.jpg)
UNIX- an operating system that allows for multitasking on early computers. Judging by the context of the article, it is unlikely that it is used on modern computers, ![](https://images.vexels.com/media/users/3/141382/isolated/preview/c7a747215c71c95b99cc87db1c211d04-unix-logo-by-vexels.png) 
What separates websites and video games from other forms of digital technology? From the text, the writer is referring to them as if they are the most common form of digital technology, or as if they are less important than other digital technologies. I hope this is addressed later. 
Ontology definition- A branch of metaphysics dealing with the nature of being. In my opinion, it sounds like it would be close to Anthropology, which is the evolution of culture. 
One thing that makes creating groups over Zoom difficult, in addition to what is mentioned after this, is the fact that most people who are in a Zoom call don't get the chance to meet in person before starting an assignment. I've had a history with group members who don't do their part, and the majority of the work becomes my responsibility. When this has happened in a classroom, I inform the teacher and if the teacher decides to change the assigned groups, then I am (usually) not in the same group as those who I had trouble with previously. I feel like with Zoom, it creates a potential environment that could make a group project awkward: most people have seen each other but never spoken to each other, and there is the problem of not knowing the personalities of your group members. It could create situations like the ones I have had to deal with throughout high school, and a surplus of these groups could be problematic not just for the students, but for the teacher as well. 
Changing the virtual structure of a project takes a lot of time and effort from the people who are involved. In some cases, structure changes are collected from consumer feedback and bug reports, while other changes are structured based on modifying the algorithm to meet the demands of a certain demographic and one-up the competition. An example of the latter was the restructuring of Tumblr in late 2018 and early 2019. Tumblr's parent company, Verizon, made some changes to make the website appeal to a wider demographic. Instead, these changes backfired; they alienated their users, disrupted the algorithm, and the demographic they tried to appeal to found these changes to be in poor taste. Moral of the story? Virtual changes take a while, so make sure that you know what needs to be changed, and if it ain't broke, don't fix it!
Another detail worth considering is that we don't see the person in full. A person may say they're fine, but they may be fidgeting with their hands or hair or trying to avoid eye contact, which are signs that the person might not be telling the truth. These are noticeable in-person, but not over Zoom. There's also the idea of eye contact. In video calls, it's expected to keep your eyes on the screen (or, at the very least, write down what you are hearing). If a person is not looking at the screen, it can be inferred that they are not paying attention or they are distracted by something around them. It is sometimes true, but there are other circumstances, such as writing notes down or having work for the class on another monitor, that cannot be noticed unless it is mentioned directly. 
Egalitarian- supporting the belief that all people are equal and deserve equal rights/opportunities. I've never heard this word before, not even in politics! 
Location data is found on some, but not all, cell phone apps. In most cases, this is a setting that can be turned off, but for others, location data is essential in order for the app to function. Examples of apps that require a person's location in order to function are "The Weather Channel" (or most weather apps) and "Find my iPhone". In the case of the former, location data is essential for displaying an accurate weather forecast. For the latter, location information is essential in order to correctly display where each device is located, and can be helpful in the event that a device is lost and/or stolen. ![](https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/9a/90/f5/9a90f511-27ed-e5ad-32c7-0c999204b217/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-7-0-0-sRGB-0-0-0-GLES2_U002c0-512MB-85-220-0-0.png/1200x630wa.png) ![](https://images.macrumors.com/t/SMqL4FEf9oZLXnJ2cGXQr9BUe6g=/1600x0/article-new/2019/07/find-my-app-icon-250x247.jpg)
Penn State is an example of this. Every ID card tracks a person's name, ID number, meal plan, and Lion Cash balance. Each person's photo is included as well, in addition to the card's expiration date (but I don't know for sure about the last part). I don't know which identifiers are used in our Penn State IDs, but it would be an interesting question for someone who knows more about the subject. 
Examples of this type of wifi are hotels and schools. While Schools have measures in place to protect the data of their students and faculty, the amount of wifi regulations in place depends on the hotel. If someone knows what they are doing, they could easily hack into a hotel's wifi and collect this information. (I know about this because my parents forced me to have all my devices run on ou hotspots instead of the hotel wifi, protecting us in the event of a data breach. A little paranoid, but understandable given the context)
CCTV- an acronym standing for closed-circuit television. These cameras come in many different shapes, including the ones pictured below ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/CCTV_Cameras.png) These are all examples of CCTV cameras that are seen in public, and you may not have realized it. 
Errors in coding can break a project; typing just one line of code incorrectly can cause everything to fall apart. There was a story that years ago, Google was down for several hours, and there was a lot of concern as to why. After investigating the issue, it was because the wrong type of slash was used in a singular line of code. I wish I could find evidence to back up this claim, but sadly, as of now, I cannot. I want to use this as an example of how the slightest errors in code can affect a program on a massive scale. 
Coding is a field of endless opportunity; there are contests based on coding/developing software (most often, video games), there are coders who create servers to revive discontinued services, and there are coders who make older software available to a new demographic. An example of this I have seen is through video games. There are several coding hobbyists and software developers invested in a field called "homebrew", which allows people to mod older games and systems that were previously unable to be modded. The problems these developers receive is to bring new life into a game or system that people loved, but is no longer supported. There are risks to coding like this, but the results can be very satisfying for potential players. 
This doesn't just apply to computers, but to other things as well. An example of the phenomena is what most people call "The Tetris Effect". This effect shows prolonged exposure to something over a short period of time causes your brain to fixate on it; whether it be a song that is really catchy, playing a video game, or spending hours on end working on something over a computer, the brain can and will fixate on these subjects, causing changes in behavior consciously and unconsciously. It is a phenomena similar to what the author is describing, and these dreams are an example of how it has affected him unconsciously. 
Modernizing the past comes in many shapes, sizes, and forms. We now have cars with rear-view cameras, cash registers that are touch-activated, toilets that flush automatically, etc. Even the smallest toys have some form of technology built into them. You know that stuffed animal that talks when you hug it? it is programmed to do that; there are buttons inside the toy that, when squeezed, will trigger one of the many voice clips that have been recorded and stored internally on that device. Many of these devices are now capable of recording a person's own voice to make customized voice clips. Devices like these require even the slightest knowledge of coding, and it's best to see one for yourself in order to understand it properly. ![](https://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00wqvGrLnCSSkc/Recordable-Sound-Voice-Music-Melody-Talking-Chip-Module-Box-Button-for-Plush-Toy-and-Teddy-Bear.jpg)
A lot of technology is made with parts that could be considered harmful if the product is damaged or destroyed, such as mercury and lead. There are warnings on several modern-day devices that warn consumers of these items before purchase, of which my laptop is an example of this. A balance between safety and efficiency is important, all while fitting the "planned obsolescence" model technology often follows. 
Bandwidth is the amount of frequencies and their efficiency given under a certain technological band. Bandwidth is similar to an internet connection: when more devices are connected to it, the more bandwidth is used. If a lot of devices are used simultaneously, the bandwidth provider will struggle to support every frequency at its full capacity, reducing the performance of some devices and creating lag as a result.
When creating a design, it is important to understand the demographic you are working with and how it is intended to be used. Ambition and risk-taking can help gain traction on the project, but it should stand out from its competitors while serving its intended purpose. It can be so ambitious that it alienates its demographic, or it can be so safe that its competitors overshadow it. Finding a balance is essential not just to innovation, but to technology as a whole. 
Vaporware: any form of technological device (computer, game console, etc.) that was advertised and marketed to the public, only to be continuously pushed back before disappearing from the market entirely. The term "Vaporware" is often used to refer to devices that will never return to market, but this is not always true; some devices are shelved due to business changes, but may be marketed again after such issues are resolved. The Phantom Game Console is an example of Vaporware that will never return to market.
